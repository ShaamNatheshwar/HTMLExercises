    <p>From Wikipedia, the <em>free</em> encylopedia.</p>

        >It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</strong
      >

      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
      distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',
      making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
      web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
      search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
      accident, sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like.

    <p>
      It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
      containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
      software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
      roots in a piece of classical
      <strong>
        Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</strong
      >
      consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
      the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
      majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
      randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
      going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
      generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
      of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
      Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
      non-characteristic words etc.

      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
      for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original
      form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
      Rackham.
